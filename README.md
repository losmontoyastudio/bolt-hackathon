## Recent Fixes and Optimizations

### IntersectionObserver Memory Leak Fix

The `PageContainer` component has been updated to properly handle IntersectionObserver cleanup, preventing memory leaks during long scrolling sessions. The following improvements were made:

1. Added proper tracking of observed elements using a Set stored in a ref
2. Implemented safe observe/unobserve methods to prevent errors
3. Properly disconnected observers and unobserved all elements during cleanup
4. Added try/catch blocks to handle potential errors during cleanup
